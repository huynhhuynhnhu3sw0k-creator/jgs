<PRE><B>1.&nbsp; What is ASCII art? or "ASCII stupid question, get a stupid ANSI."&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is ASCII art?&nbsp; Basically, it's creating pictures using the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; letters and symbols found on a regular keyboard or typewriter.&nbsp; Trust&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me, the computer keyboard is MUCH easier to use than a typewriter.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Related art can be done with ANSI (sometimes known as "higher ASCII")&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; characters, but since those don't show up on Aladdin or GEnie, I've&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; never played with them.&nbsp; Most everyone has seen some sort of ASCII&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; art, either in regular ASCII Art topics, (such as in the Family RT),&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as part of the opening screen for various RoundTables, or as part of a&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cute little signature by the members themselves.&nbsp; This is a sample of&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a signature ASCII art:&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ('v')&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (&nbsp;&nbsp; )&nbsp;&nbsp; "Birdie"&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~/'~'~~&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My pictures are done for the computer screen, and look best on a&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; screen that is set for a dark background and light letters.&nbsp; Viewing&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pictures on a light background with dark letters (either on the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; screen or on paper, printed up) makes them look a little like photo&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; negatives, light where it's supposed to be dark, and dark where it's&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; supposed to be light.&nbsp; Just keep in mind how your pictures will be&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; viewed, while you're creating them.&nbsp; Some of the pictures I've done&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will "translate" just fine to a different setup, some don't do nearly&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as well.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
2.&nbsp; The CANVAS, or "Targon's secret."&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the very first ASCII artists on GEnie, TARGON, came up with the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; idea of creating a "canvas."&nbsp; To make it easier to put your characters&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where they need to go, start with a blank canvas.&nbsp; In most word&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; processing programs, (including Aladdin's text editor), the cursor&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can't be moved somewhere it's never been before.&nbsp; That's fine if you&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know exactly where you want each character, and can type it in&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perfectly the first time, but if you need to experiment, like I do,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you'll want to move that cursor around with your arrow keys.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The canvas consists of a screen full of lines, and the lines consist&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of nothing but spaces you've tapped in with your spacebar.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the way I made mine:&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, go to the program you plan to use to make your pictures. Since&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I use Aladdin, I'll describe the procedure I use.&nbsp; While offline, go&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to a reply screen, such as the ASCII Art topic in the FAMILY BB.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Category 3, topic 18.)&nbsp; Hit "r" for "reply."&nbsp; When the screen comes&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up, draw a line of dashes across the top, and then hit the enter key&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oh... about twenty times or so.&nbsp; At the end of the screen, draw&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another line of dashes across the bottom.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go back to the top of the screen, press the down arrow once, and start&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hitting the space bar.&nbsp; When you get to the end of the line, use the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; down arrow to get to the next line.&nbsp; Do not hit "enter" again, and do&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not let the line of spaces wrap around.&nbsp; Hit the space bar again,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filling the next line with spaces, and again when you get to the end&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the line, use the down arrow key to get to the next line.&nbsp; Continue&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doing this till you've filled all 20 lines with blank spaces.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, it would be wise to "save" the "canvas" so that you&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't have to go through this every time you want to do a picture.&nbsp; To&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; save a file on Aladdin, you hold down the control key and tap the K,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then the W.&nbsp; A little screen will pop up, asking for a name.&nbsp; I chose&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the name "canvas," but then, I'm an original thinker.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; From then&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on, when you want to create a new picture, you can "recall" the canvas&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by going to a reply screen.&nbsp; To recall the canvas using Aladdin, hold&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; down the control key and tap the K then the R.&nbsp; You'll see that little&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; window come up, asking for a file name, and you type in the name you&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gave your canvas.&nbsp; Then hit enter, and the canvas will be on the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; screen.&nbsp; For those who would rather skip this step, I've included a&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; canvas at the end of the file.&nbsp; Since most of my pictures are rather&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; large, the canvas is larger than I've specified here.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
3.&nbsp; How to start, or "Whaddaya mean, just start tapping keys?"&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you're ready to begin creating your picture.&nbsp; The first thing you&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need to do is make sure your text editor is in "overwrite" mode.&nbsp; In&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aladdin's default setting, that means you'll need to hit the "insert"&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; key one time.&nbsp; This way, each character you tap into place will&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overwrite the blank space.&nbsp; If you do not have your text editor in&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overwrite mode, each character you tap in will be inserted between&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your spaces, and the lines will begin to wrap almost immediately.&nbsp; If&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that happens, don't panic, just delete the extra keys, press the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "insert" key and start again.&nbsp; I guarantee you, you'll notice quickly.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another pointer to remember:&nbsp; If you've tapped something in and you&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't like it, or if you've made a mistake, do NOT erase it using the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; backspace key.&nbsp; The backspace key will delete that space, and it'll&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offset the rest of that line by one.&nbsp; You may not notice that if&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you've only backspaced once, but if you've backspaced a dozen&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; characters out of the way, you'll have a line that's shorter than the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rest by that many spaces.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to correct a mistake, just use your arrow keys till the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cursor is on the space you want to change, and tap in the character&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you want.&nbsp; (Again, make sure you are in overwrite mode.)&nbsp; If you&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forget and backspace an error away, hit the insert key again, then hit&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the spacebar till you've added back in the spaces you accidentally&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deleted, then hit the insert key again to go back to overwrite mode.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, one more thing... For some reason, it's best to leave the first&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; space on each line blank.&nbsp; Your art will look fine while you're&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creating it, but when it gets uploaded to GEnie a character on the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very first space of the line will cause the following lines get&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shifted over one space, and that's enough to mess up a picture.&nbsp; This&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is especially true if you have used any asterisks (*) as first&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; characters on the line.&nbsp; The asterisk is used on GEnie to say, "The&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; following is a command, not part of the text."&nbsp; People viewing your&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work won't even see that line.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
4.&nbsp; Sources, or "Where do I find pictures to try?"&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of us have some little doodle we've done for years... I've always&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drawn little elephant fannies all over papers and scraps.&nbsp; I'd suggest&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that you translate YOUR doodle to ASCII art as your first piece.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; familiar, and you'll know if it doesn't look quite right.&nbsp; Play with&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it till you're satisfied with it.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For your next piece, choose something simple.&nbsp; You'll have an easier&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time, and you'll build your confidence.&nbsp; Children's coloring books are&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a great place to find simple pictures to try.&nbsp; While you're finding&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sorts of pictures you enjoy doing, you'll be developing your very&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own style of ASCII art.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the greatest things about this particular art form is that each&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; style is so distinctively different. Once an artist has the basics&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; down, you can almost tell WHO did a picture before you see their name&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; Some of the ASCII Artists you've&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; probably seen at one time or another here on GEnie are TARGON,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PHOENIX, TSUEX, and RIKROK.&nbsp; All of these people have very individual&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; styles.&nbsp; Some pictures look like drawings with ASCII characters, some&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look more like paintings.&nbsp; They're all delightful.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holiday pictures are my favorites.&nbsp; I can find samples from&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newspapers, comic books, coloring books, art books, and sometimes from&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my own imagination.&nbsp; Most of the time I need a pattern, even if the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finished product doesn't look anything like the original.&nbsp; It gives me&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an idea of where to go first.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;
&nbsp;
5.&nbsp; Choosing Characters, or "Which characters do I want to use?"&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, your choice of characters depends on what effect you're&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; looking for.&nbsp; If you are "sketching" with ASCII characters, you'll&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; want to pay special attention to the following keys:&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; / ` " ' \ , . _ - = ~ ^ ; |&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice that all of these characters have been entered on the same&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; line, but many are in different positions on that line.&nbsp; The&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apostrophy is higher on the line than the comma, for instance.&nbsp; Keep&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this in mind as you "sketch" because sometimes that small difference&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is enough to make or break your picture.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are going for a more filled in look, such as I do in my&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pictures, you will also want to keep in mind the relative value of the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; characters as far as light and shade go.&nbsp; Look at the following&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; characters:&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @ # $ &amp; X % > / ; :&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice that when you are using a dark background, light letters, that&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the @ and # keys provide a lot of light.&nbsp; You would use these&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; characters to highlight your work.&nbsp; The : and ; let much less light&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through, so those would be the characters you shade with.&nbsp; If you are&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; working on a reverse screen, with a light background/dark characters,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the opposite would hold true.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep in mind, too, that for detail work there are several characters&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that are very similar, but subtly different, and can add just the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right amount of contrast to get the effect that you want.&nbsp; For&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instance:&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S $&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 O&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more thing that will help you get the look you want is the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relative height of capital and lower case letters. When you need a&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; line to taper a bit, using a lower case letter is sometimes the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perfect "bridge" between high and low characters.&nbsp; For instance:&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O o&nbsp;&nbsp; @ a&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To taper these lines even further, when a very gradual decrease is&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wanted, use both of these methods, somtimes using them more than once.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance:&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ss,..,sS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -=*@*=-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .,%,.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SSss,,..,,ssSS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ..,,;;|;;,,..&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also remember that what is low on one line can be the perfect bridge&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for something high on the line directly under.&nbsp; This is especially&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; helpful when you're creating signatures of some kind... For instance:&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,;;;,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;;&nbsp; .;'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `;,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . `';,.&nbsp; .;. ;.&nbsp;&nbsp; ,;;;, .;.&nbsp; .;;;.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ';.&nbsp; ;;&nbsp; ;; ;;&nbsp;&nbsp; ',,.&nbsp;&nbsp; ;;&nbsp; ;; ;;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,;;;.;;&nbsp; ;;&nbsp; ;; ;;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp; ;;&nbsp; ;;&nbsp; ;;''&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;;&nbsp;&nbsp; ';;;;'&nbsp;&nbsp; `;;';;' ';;;'&nbsp; ';. `;;;'&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `;;;;'&nbsp;
&nbsp;
6.&nbsp; Small pictures, or "Good things come in small packages."&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VERY small pictures can be a lot of fun to do.&nbsp; Just remember that&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with those tiny ASCII pictures, a LOT is left to the imagination.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes a suggestion of what you're looking for is the best you can&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do.&nbsp; For instance, the following was done on only two lines:&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~|_&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (_)\_&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's certainly no photograph, but most people will recognize this as a&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wheelchair.&nbsp; Another fun use for tiny ASCII graphics are for signing&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; off e-mail, especially during the holidays.&nbsp; For instance, during the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christmas season, I like to sign letters off with one of the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; following:&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;\oOo/>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ### ###&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ### ###&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /\&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //\\&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ///\\\&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ][&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's important to remember that many RoundTables on GEnie (Such as the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FAMILY and Personal Growth RoundTable) frown on the use of excessive&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASCII art in regular topics. This is due to the fact that users who&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are visually impaired and use voice synthesizers have a heck of a time&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with this stuff...&nbsp; For instance, a blind user coming across the top&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christmas miniature would hear, "lesser than, backslash, o, O, o,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slash, greater than..."&nbsp; And that's only the FIRST ROW!&nbsp; Can you&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imagine how irritating that would be?&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some voice synthesizers do not "pronounce" punctuation, but they do&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pause for many punctuation marks.&nbsp; For instance, if your little ASCII&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; picture consists of a lot of periods and commas, the voice synthesizer&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will pause for each.&nbsp; If there's enough there, the user may think that&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he or she was discontinued.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are on a RoundTable and you don't know what their policy is,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it's best to preface any ASCII art with a warning phrase, placed a&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; line above the actual art:&nbsp; "WARNING:&nbsp; ASCII Art to follow."&nbsp; And&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't be offended if it's returned to you.&nbsp; There are many ASCII Art&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; topics on GEnie, and your work is VERY welcome there.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;
&nbsp;
7.&nbsp; Big pictures, or "Bigger is better, right?"&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though a large picture can be a little intimidating, it is often&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; easier to do than a small picture.&nbsp; Large pictures give you room to&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add detail.&nbsp; If you are doing a picture on, say, ten lines, you don't&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have as much room to develop curves and angles.&nbsp; Your work has to be&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; much more precise, and it's not always possible.&nbsp; On the other hand,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on a large picture, you have much more room to develop not only curves&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and angles, but also shading and highlighting.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where do you start on a large picture?&nbsp; Well, first of all you'll&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; probably want more than one "canvas" to work on.&nbsp; Just add another&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; canvas or two on the end of the previous one so that you have plenty&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of room.&nbsp; Get rid of the excess lines between them with the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "control-y" keysequence.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some ASCII artists consistently start with the eyes, if the picture&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAS eyes.&nbsp; Personally, I start in a different place each time, but&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most often I start on what will give me the most problems.&nbsp; For&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instance, on the tiger I started with the nose.&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHY that nose was such a bugger (sorry, couldn't resist... :) but once&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got that done, I figured I could finish the rest of the picture.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other times, when there isn't an area that I feel I need to start on,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might start at the very top, so that I can get a relative feel for&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the width and length of the picture.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I've started the picture, I will most of the time go ahead and&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tap in the rest of the basic shape.&nbsp; Afterwards I'll go through and&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; add the highlighting, shading, and other detail work that I want.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes when you're sitting so close to the screen, tapping in the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pictures, NOTHING you do looks right.&nbsp; If that's the case, stand back&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the screen.... Or squint your eyes.&nbsp; Or if you wear glasses, take&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them off for a moment.&nbsp; Many times you'll see the picture "come&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; together" when you try one of these little tricks.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you're finished, make sure you save your picture.&nbsp; You save your&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; picture the same way you saved the canvas; hold down the control key,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit the K and then the W.&nbsp; When the screen comes up, give your picture&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a name.&nbsp; That way you can bring it up again whenever you'd like.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
8.&nbsp; ASCII Art protocol, or "Gee, this is neat, can I show my friends?"&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASCII art IS neat, and it's great to get it in the mail.&nbsp; Kids (and&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the kid in all of us) enjoy watching it download, as the picture takes&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shape right before our eyes.&nbsp; Though I can only speak for myself, I&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't mind at all when pictures are "shared" with others.&nbsp; Some of my&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pictures have been to many different countries, on many other&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continents, and that tickles me.&nbsp; Though tastes differ, appreciation&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of art is something everyone has in common, especially in such a fun,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unexpected form as ASCII art.&nbsp; What I do ask, though, is that my name&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be left on the picture.&nbsp; If you KNOW the source of the art, include&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the artist's name.&nbsp; It's not enough to put in a line that says, "yes,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it's stolen."&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been times in the past that I've received my OWN artwork&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back in e-mail to me, along with a note that says, "See, you're not&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the only one who can do this stuff..."&nbsp; Even more irritating is seeing&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my own picture with credit given to someone else.&nbsp; This stuff may not&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be as "important" as some great literary work, but ASCII artists DO&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spend an hour or more on each picture to make something that will give&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; others pleasure.&nbsp; Give them credit.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
9.&nbsp; Printing up ASCII Art -- or "Eww. Why does this look so bad on paper?"&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is it when we print up this ASCII art it looks sort of squatty?&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason is that the "characters per inch" is different on the paper&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than it is on the screen.&nbsp; In old "typewriting" terms, "Pica" print is&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ten characters to the inch.&nbsp; "Elite" print is twelve characters to the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inch.&nbsp; The screen is fairly close to "elite," the default pitch of&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many printers is closer to "pica."&nbsp; The printer will print the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; line character by character rather than inch at a time.&nbsp; The&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; difference isn't much, but when the picture is six inches wide, that&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; means when it's printed, it'll be seven and a half inches wide. Thus,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the "squatty" look.&nbsp; To correct it, when you print out the work,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change the default pitch to something that is closer to the size on&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the screen.&nbsp; If you play with it enough, it'll work out.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second reason ASCII art may look a little strange on paper is that&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it may have been created for a dark rather than a light background.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Paper is light.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, if I create a picture, using the&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @##@ characters as highlights, it's easy for you to see that on a&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; white piece of paper, those characters are actually DARK, not light.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution is to either&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) keep in mind HOW the picture will be&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seen.&nbsp; If your picture will be seen mostly printed up, work on a light&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; background with dark characters while you're creating it.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Hand&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the picture to a child to color.&nbsp; They can fix anything. :)&nbsp;
